There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable.

“Parasitism is the most common life history strategy on the planet1. The evolutionary success of this strategy hinges on increasing transmission to new hosts2. Transmission to a novel host is the product of both the contact rate between the infected and susceptible host and

the probability of transmission per contact3. Parasites increase their probability of transmission by exploiting their host resources in order to increase within-host densities. However, host exploitation can result in host damage4, often referred to as parasite virulence, which can reduce the number of contacts an infected host makes with susceptible hosts through increased host mortality, a more rapid parasite elimination by the host immune response, and by decreasing the infected host’s mobility. Thus, the number of new infections arising from one infected host, which is equivalent to parasite fitness, is constrained by a tradeoff between maximizing transmission per contact with susceptible hosts

\section{Questions I still have}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Put two figs together side-by-side, or top bottom (Fig.  \ref{fig:figLegendWrapWrap}) and (Fig.  \ref{fig:FancefigLegend})
    \item wrap fig legend and wrap main text around fig and fig legend (Fig.  \ref{fig:figLegendWrapWrap})
    \item Black line around fig+legend
    \item Fig legend with less white space near image
    \item Tables
    \item Should all of this just be done (with fig legends and all) to make a separate image and then put the whole image in?
